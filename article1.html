                    <div id='canal'>1. Corinth Canal</div>

                    <p>The idea of building a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth (which connects the Peloponnese to
                        the rest of Greece) was conceived by the tyrant Periander in the sixth century BC to link the
                        Ionian and Aegean Seas. Its completion, however, didn't come about until the late 1800s after
                        modern Greece gained independence.
                        Today, the Corinth Canal, which is four kilometers east of modern Corinth, is the city's top
                        attraction. Creating it between 1882 and 1893 involved an excavation up to 80 meters in depth to
                        create a canal that is 6.3 kilometers long, 23 meters wide, and eight meters deep and can
                        accommodate vessels of up to 10,000 tons.
                        The best view of the canal is from the bridge, which carries the road over it. One of the most
                        interesting features, however, is the submersible bridge at the north-west end. It can be sunk
                        below the surface, allowing smaller ships and sailing boats to pass through after paying a hefty
                        tariff. However, it is too narrow for larger ships.

                    <p id='ancientCorinth'>2. Ancient Corinth</p>

                    <P>Ancient Corinth is an important archaeological site, which has revealed many great finds. Once
                        one of the most powerful cities of the Classical world, it came under Roman rule in 146 BC. It
                        is here that St. Paul preached to the people of Corinth in AD 51-52, and his experience later
                        inspired him to write the New Testament books of the First Corinthians and Second Corinthians,
                        among the most quoted books of the Bible. Today, amid the archaeological excavations, you can
                        see the ruins of various buildings including temples, a forum, baths, and a basilica. </p>
                    <p id='apolloTemple'>3. Temple of Apollo</p>
                    <p>The most important monument in Ancient Corinth, the imposing Doric Temple of Apollo lies on a low
                        hill and dominates the site. The temple was built around 540 BC, on the site of an earlier
                        seventh-century-BC temple. Today, only seven monolithic limestone columns remain, but originally
                        there would have been six along the front and back of the temple, and fifteen down each side. In
                        the first century AD, the Romans moved the main entrance into the temple to the west (formerly
                        it had been on the east), and they built stoas (colonnaded walkways) to each side of the temple.
                    </p>
                    <p id='corinthMuseum'>4. Corinth Archaeological Museum</p>
                    <p>This small museum provides a comprehensive view of finds from the Ancient Corinth archaeological
                        site. Built in 1931-32 and extended in the 1950s, the museum has three display rooms and a large
                        courtyard. The main attractions are Neolithic finds, typical Corinthian pottery and ceramics,
                        mosaic floors, and numerous headless marble statues (the ancients would simply remove the head
                        of a deceased leader from a statue, and replace it with the new leader's head). Exhibits are
                        labeled in both Greek and English. The entrance ticket to the site is also valid for the museum.
                    </p>
                    <p id='acrocorinth'>5. Acrocorinth</p>
                    <p>Acrocorinth (Akrokórinthos) lies 3.5 kilometers south of Ancient Corinth. The ascent to the top
                        of this impressive fortified hilltop (575 meters) is made easier by a road, which climbs to a
                        point near the lowest gate on the west side. Acrocorinth was fortified in ancient times, and its
                        defenses were maintained and developed during the Byzantine, Frankish, Turkish, and Venetian
                        periods, so that its walls now measure almost two kilometers in length.
                        Within the fortress, a path leads to the highest point, to the former Temple of Aphrodite, which
                        was converted into a mosque by the Ottoman Turks in the 16th century. From here, there are fine
                        views of the Isthmus and the hills of the Peloponnese.

                    <p id='loutraki'>6. Loutraki</p>
                    <p>Overlooking the Gulf of Corinth, six kilometers northeast of Corinth, Loutráki is a popular
                        seaside resort, which is wonderful to spend an afternoon wandering around, especially if you're
                        in need of some heat therapy. Here you'll find natural thermal springs at the Loutraki Spa,
                        where you can spend some time soaking and sipping the healing water that is recommended for
                        disorders of the urinary tract, kidney stones, gallstones, and gout.
                        The old town of Loutraki was destroyed by an earthquake in 1928, and today it consists mainly of
                        concrete hotels erected during the second half of the 20th century.

                    <p id='stymphalia'>7. Environment Museum of Stymphalia</p>
                    <p>One of the most popular tourist attractions in Corinth is a museum dedicated to the region's
                        eco-system, mainly Lake Stymphalia, where, according to mythology, Hercules confronted and
                        defeated the Stymphalian birds with his arrow. The lake itself is a wonderfully relaxing spot to
                        wander or run along the path around it. The museum, back in town, has two permanent exhibits.
                        The first addresses environmental concerns in the region, and the second explores the ways in
                        which the environment has influenced development in the lake's basin.
